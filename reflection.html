        <h2>Reflection on Learning Outcomes</h2>
        <p>This module facilitated exploration of dashboards in Fintech from both academic and practical angles. Initially, I focused on reviewing existing research concerning dashboards in performance management, business intelligence, and financial data visualisation. As the module progressed into the research proposal and presentation stages, my understanding deepened regarding how dashboards operate within decision-making contexts, encompassing both technical functionality and methodological implications. One of the most significant developments was learning to engage critically with academic literature; my initial approach was largely descriptive, summarising sources, but it evolved into a more analytical style involving the comparison of different research viewpoints and findings. Research design was an entirely new area for me; the process of selecting an appropriate methodology (mixed-methods in this case) was challenging yet rewarding, teaching me how to structure a coherent and effective study. Furthermore, I significantly strengthened my skills in academic writing, project planning, and time management. Crafting the detailed research proposal transcript and the accompanying PowerPoint presentation honed my ability to condense complex information into clear, structured arguments. The exercise of translating written content into visually engaging slides not only improved my presentation delivery skills but also solidified my grasp of the core concepts.</p>

        <h2>Feedback from Tutor and Responses</h2>
        <p>Tutor feedback was instrumental in shaping my learning. For the literature review, while my knowledge base was acknowledged as "very good," the feedback highlighted the need to delve deeper into contrasting research findings and to move beyond citing only one source per paragraph to foster more robust critical discussion. This prompted me to revisit my writing and actively incorporate multiple perspectives to strengthen the analysis. Advice on citations emphasized that rigorous referencing builds stronger arguments and adds credibility, extending beyond the basic requirement of avoiding plagiarism. Feedback on the research proposal presentation was positive regarding delivery and content, but noted that the full allocated time wasn't used and suggested expanding the discussion, particularly around the strengths and limitations of the chosen research design. This served as a valuable lesson in oral assessment time management and the importance of self-critique in research planning. It also reinforced the need to explicitly address practical and ethical considerations within research proposals.</p>

        <h2>Artefacts Developed</h2>
        <p>Several key artefacts were produced throughout this module, demonstrating the progression of learning. These included: a comprehensive literature review drawing exclusively from academic sources; a detailed research proposal outlining clear aims, objectives, research questions, and a mixed-methods methodology; and a PowerPoint presentation designed to showcase the project's key themes, research considerations, and proposed timeline. Each task contributed to developing distinct skills: writing the proposal transcript enhanced my ability to articulate complex ideas clearly and logically, while designing the presentation slides necessitated prioritizing key information for visual communication. Collectively, these assignments served to strengthen both my academic research capabilities and transferable professional skills like communication and planning.</p>

        <h2>Working Autonomously</h2>
        <p>The module required a high degree of autonomous work. I independently managed every stage of the project, from the initial sourcing and critical analysis of academic literature to formulating research questions and structuring the final proposal. I proactively sought clarification and feedback when needed and utilized additional resources to enhance my understanding, specifically researching best practices for conducting literature reviews and applying qualitative research methods effectively. As there was no group work component, I took full ownership of my learning trajectory and progress, which significantly reinforced my self-discipline, time management, and sense of academic responsibility.</p>

        <h2>Emotional Impact and Development</h2>
        <p>My emotional journey through this module involved significant shifts. Initially, I felt overwhelmed and experienced moments of frustration, largely stemming from my unfamiliarity with formal research proposals, structured literature reviews, and complex methodological decisions. However, as I dedicated time to engaging deeply with the course materials and assigned tasks, I began to recognize patterns in academic research and grew more confident in my ability to construct logical arguments and structure my work. Gradually, the initial anxiety transformed into a sense of enjoyment, particularly in the process of piecing together different academic perspectives and seeing my research proposal take shape. This positive shift in mindset significantly boosted my motivation and, I believe, ultimately contributed to improving the quality of my final submissions.</p>

        <h2>Commitment to Academic Integrity</h2>
        <p>Maintaining academic integrity was a key focus, particularly after receiving initial feedback on citation practices. I made a conscious and dedicated effort to improve how I integrated and referenced sources. This involved revisiting each paragraph of my work to ensure multiple viewpoints were considered where appropriate and confirming that all references adhered correctly to the Harvard referencing style. In both the research proposal transcript and the presentation materials, citations were used carefully and deliberately, strictly avoiding non-academic sources to uphold academic rigour. This process deepened my appreciation for referencing, not merely as a procedural formality, but as a fundamental practice for building credible, evidence-based arguments in academic discourse.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion and Future Application</h2>
        <p>Overall, this module represents a significant and transformative learning experience. The process of selecting a research topic, critically reviewing relevant literature, designing a feasible research study, and presenting the proposal has substantially built my confidence in handling complex academic work from start to finish. I now feel considerably better equipped with the necessary research and analytical skills to tackle future academic modules, and potentially a dissertation project. The challenges encountered along the way, particularly in areas like critical analysis and research design, pushed me to develop new competencies, and witnessing the progress made has been incredibly rewarding and motivating for future academic endeavours.</p>
