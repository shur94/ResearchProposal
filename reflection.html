        <h2>Reflection on Learning Outcomes</h2>
        <p>This module broadened my understanding of Fintech dashboards academically and practically. I progressed from basic literature summarisation to critical analysis and grasped research design, notably mixed-methods, whilst also sharpening my academic writing, project management, and time-keeping skills.</p>

        <h2>Feedback from Tutor and Responses</h2>
        <p>Tutor feedback highlighted the need for deeper critical engagement with literature by contrasting findings and using multiple sources, which I addressed. Advice on citations stressed their importance for robust arguments. Presentation feedback encouraged better time management and a more thorough discussion of the research design's strengths and limitations.</p>

        <h2>Artefacts Developed</h2>
        <p>I produced a literature review using academic sources, a detailed research proposal outlining my research approach, and a presentation to showcase the project. These tasks collectively enhanced my academic research abilities and transferable professional skills like communication and planning.</p>

        <h2>Working Autonomously</h2>
        <p>The module demanded independent work across all project stages, from literature analysis to proposal structuring. This self-led approach, including seeking clarification and using extra resources, significantly boosted my self-discipline and academic responsibility.</p>

        <h2>Emotional Impact and Development</h2>
        <p>Initially feeling overwhelmed by the research process, my confidence grew as I engaged with the material and saw my proposal develop. This positive shift in mindset increased my motivation and, I believe, improved the quality of my final submissions.</p>

        <h2>Commitment to Academic Integrity</h2>
        <p>Following initial feedback, I consciously improved my citation practices, ensuring multiple perspectives were considered and adhering strictly to the Harvard style using only academic sources. This deepened my appreciation for referencing as crucial for building credible academic arguments.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion and Future Application</h2>
        <p>Overall, this module has been a significant learning experience, substantially increasing my confidence in handling complex academic work from start to finish. I now feel better equipped with research and analytical skills for future academic modules and potential dissertation work.</p>
